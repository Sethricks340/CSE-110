#### Which are each of the following? (string, int, float)
x = '10'#string
y = 5 #integer
z = 3.14 #float
# print(x*5, y, z*2)

#### What do the following do?
x = int(x) #converts x to an integer
y = float(y) #converts y to a float
z = str(z) #Converts z to a string

# print(x, y, z+2)

#### Which is better?
# print("I have " + str(x) + " cats.")
# print(f"I have {x} cats.")

#### Order of operations

Operator	Description
()	        Parentheses
**	        Exponent
* / // %	Multiply, Divide, Floor divide, Modulo
+ -	        Addition, Subtraction
= 	        Assign
'''

#Floor divide: 5//2 = 2.5 
#just the integer not the remainder

# Modulo: 5%2 
# The remainder operator (5/2 is 2 R 1) 1 is the Modulo

#### What is stored in a, b, c and d? 
a = 10 + (4 * 2) - 3  
b = 5 % 2  
c = 5 // 2
d = 5 / 2 #gives me a float result
# print(f'math {a}, modulo {b}, floor divide {c}, normal divide {d}')

#### Team Activity
## Core requirements: 
# get user input (be able to handle ints or floats)
# convert it to a number so you can do some math with it (float)
# calculate areas of 3 shapes

# side = ???(input('What\'s the length of one side: '))
